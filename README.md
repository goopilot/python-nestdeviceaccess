# COMS4995

I'm not exactly sure what I want to work on, but I'm currently very interested in Internet of Things and Smart Home projects, so I'm hoping to have my project be in that space.

Two projects I'd be interested in contributing to include:
- https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip
- https://github.com/swapagarwal/JARVIS-on-Messenger
